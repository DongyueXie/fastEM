Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  .gitignore

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/fastEM_regression.Rmd

Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to

<h2>Linear regression with mixture-of-normals priors</h2>
<p>Next, we consider a less simple case in which the regression
coefficients are independently and identically drawn from mixture of
zero-centered normals; this can be seen as a multivariate extension to
the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041">adaptive
shrinkage model</a>, so we call this “multivariate regression adaptive
shrinkage” (mr-ash). Although posterior computations with this model are
more difficult than with ridge regression, we can nonetheless obtain
simple co-ordinate ascent updates for computing posterior expectations
of the coefficients if we introduce a <em>variational approximation</em>
to the posterior distribution. The full derivation is omitted here; see
the code in the <code>mr_ash_update</code> function for details. (Note
that the co-ordinate ascent updates, unlike the ridge regression
updates, are only guaranteed to recover a <em>local maximum</em> of the
objective function being optimized.)</p>
<p>These two variables specify the variances and mixture weights for the
mixture-of-normals priors. Here we illustrate mr-ash with a prior that
is a mixture of three normals.</p>
